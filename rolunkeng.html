	<h1>about</h1>
	<p>How good would it be if you could eat such a cookie every day? Don't have time to bake? Who will eat a whole baking sheet when only you are hungry?
Sweetmug is the answer! It’s delicious, quick to make, and the amount is ideal. We developed the perfect recipe just for you, and to make it easier for you, we wrote it on the side of the mug,
to always be at hand. Since the units are given in tablespoons, you don't even have to take out the scale! A striking gift for anyone, but it can always come in handy at home as well.
Come to our fairs or order online and you won’t regret it!</p>
